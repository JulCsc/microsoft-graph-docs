Prior to using Microsoft Graph Data Connect (Data Connect) for the first time, you need to configure your Microsoft 365 tenant. This involves turning on the service to approve data extraction requests.

## Enable Data Connect in your Microsoft 365 tenant

This step describes how you enable the Data Connect service on your Microsoft 365 tenant.

1. Open a browser, go to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), and sign in with your "admin" user.

2. On the left navigation pane, select **Settings > Org settings**. You might have to choose **Show all** before you can view **Settings**.

3. In the **Services** tab (which should be the default selection), select the **Microsoft Graph Data Connect** service.

4. Select the checkbox that says **Turn Microsoft Graph Data Connect on or off for your entire organization.** and choose **Save**.
